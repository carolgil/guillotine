<!--
  I'm making heavy use of `.try` in this template since when it is used to
  render a blank credit card form `donation` (and thus `donation.pledger`) will
  be nil. `.try` is a rails addition to ruby which returns nil instead of
  throwing when a method doesn't exist.

  `donation.try(:pledger)` is the same as `donation.pledger rescue nil` but it
  can be chained like `donation.try(:pledger).try(:name)` or whatever.

<% pledger = donation.try(:pledger) %>

<pre>
Rendering credit card form.

Donation:
<%= number_to_currency donation.try(:amount) %>

Pledger:
<%= pledger.try(:name) %>
</pre>
